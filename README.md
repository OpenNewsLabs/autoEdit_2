## Ready to use release 

See [releases section](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2/releases) to download latest packaged version ready to use. 
All you need to get started is IBM Watson API Blumix keys. [Check out the user manual](hhttps://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/autoedit2-user-manual/content/) and the [developer's documentation](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/autoedit-2-r-d-documentation-for-developers/content/)

2. the user can make text selections

<!-- ![Transcription ](/docs/img/gif/3_transcription.gif) -->

Watch [video overview of the transcription part on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z143-nJlzs).

The app uses IBM watson(free trial), as well as Gentle and pocketsphinx open source Speech To Text systems to generate transcription.
The user can then select text and export a video sequence to the video editing software of choice.

Is designed so that the front end in backbone can be used as standalone static site. Which is how 
[the demo](https://opennewslabs.github.io/autoEdit_2/demo/index.html) is run, with an hard coded sample data in `backbone.sync`.

For more info [check out the documentation](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/autoedit-2-documentation/content/).

### -->Papereditig<--

As of version `1.0.6` you can pull selections from multiple transcriptions into a paperedit, see a video preview, and export as an EDL video sequence. [Check out the user manual for more on this](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/autoedit2-user-manual/content/paperediting.html).

### --> Move to electron<--
As of version `1.0.7` (soon to be released) moved from nwjs to electron to package the app for desktop. This will allow to do a leap forward in certain areas of the roadmap. 

## Development

### Launching the app

```bash
npm install
``` 

and then run the following comand to compile the js client side files with browserify and start electron. 

```bash
npm start
```

You'd also need to get IBM watson STT keys or have the Gentle Open source app running locally [see the guide for instructions on setting this up ](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/autoedit2-user-manual/content/chapter1.html)

### Building/packaging the app - OSX

Building and packaging the app, can be done with one comand. 


```bash
npm run build:mac:dmg
```

This install dependencies, runs browserify on the client side js code, builds the electron application in the `./dist` folder and packages into a dmg image which is saved into the `~/dist` folder as well. 


### Building/packaging the app - Linux
